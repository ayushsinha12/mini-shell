# Mini Shell | Custom Unix Shell in C

A full-featured Unix-style shell written in C that implements tokenization, parsing, process control, and command execution from scratch. This project supports shell operators such as sequencing (`;`), input/output redirection (`<`, `>`), and pipes (`|`). It includes built-in commands, error handling, and a robust tokenizer that handles quoted arguments and special characters.

## Description

Mini Shell is a fully functional Unix-style shell built from scratch in C, implementing a tokenizer, parser, and command execution system. The shell supports both basic and advanced shell operations including command sequencing (`;`), input/output redirection (`<`, `>`), and piping (`|`). It features a custom-built tokenizer that processes raw command-line input into lexical tokens, supporting quoted strings and special shell characters.

The shell executes system commands, manages child processes using `fork` and `execvp`, and includes built-in commands such as `cd`, `source`, `prev`, and `help`. It handles user input interactively through a prompt loop, supporting graceful exit via `exit` or `Ctrl-D`. Error handling, memory management (validated via Valgrind), and command parsing follow a deterministic grammar-based design. The project was compiled and tested using a custom Makefile and evaluated against rigorous functional test cases.

## Features

- **Custom Tokenizer**  
  Parses command-line input into tokens including quoted strings and special shell characters.

- **Shell Execution Engine**  
  Runs system commands via child processes with correct I/O handling and error messaging.

- **Command Sequencing (`;`)**  
  Supports multiple commands in one line executed in sequence.

- **Input Redirection (`<`)**  
  Routes file input to stdin of a command.

- **Output Redirection (`>`)**  
  Writes stdout of a command to a specified file.

- **Pipe Operator (`|`)**  
  Connects output of one command to input of another.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Built-in Commands**  
  - `cd`: Change directory  
  - `source`: Run script files  
  - `prev`: Re-run the last command  
  - `help`: Show help for built-in commands  
  - `exit` / `Ctrl-D`: Exit the shell

- **Makefile Build System**  
  Includes targets to build, clean, and test both tokenizer and shell.
